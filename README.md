# Dino Race
Phaser scrolling, animation, and controller demo

## Follow along to the direction to build a full dino race game.

Currently implemented:
- [x] Spritesheet and Animation
- [ ] Platforming and Side Scrolling
- [ ] Controller input + Multiplayer


## Spritesheets

First you need assets, this has typically been the most difficult for me.
I know I'm _not_ a great artist but there are plenty of people who will share their talents for free.

The dinosaur assets are coming from [@ScissorMarks](https://twitter.com/ScissorMarks), you can check out the page here https://arks.itch.io/dino-characters

I've used the Aseprite files to view the spritesheet and re-export them, this time with the matching json files.
Phaser can import and read these json files and automatically slice the sprite sheet into the separate animations that were tagged in Aseprite.
